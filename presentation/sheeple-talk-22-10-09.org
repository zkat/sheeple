#+TITLE: Sheeple: Dynamic Object-Orientation for CL
#+AUTHOR: Josh Marchán

* What is Class-orientation?
** Setting up the strawman...
#+LaTeX:\pause
*** Write general blueprints, create objects based on them to hold some (limited) changeable state.
#+LaTeX:\pause
*** Otherwise, objects are fairly static
#+LaTeX:\pause
*** Nothing object-oriented about classes.
    Saying class-orientation is "object-oriented" is a damn filthy lie.
#+LaTeX:\pause
*** "Static constructs considered harmful" (for dynamic languages)
** Hope?
#+LaTeX:\pause
*** Python - arbitrary attributes
#+LaTeX:\pause
*** Ruby - open classes
#+LaTeX:\pause
*** Smalltalk - Everything is an instance of a class, including classes.
#+LaTeX:\pause
*** CLOS - class redefinition, change-class, EQL specializers, MOP
** Example: Developing a game
   Goal: Write a game

   You're mapping to conceptual objects. Class-orientation seems like a perfect fit.

   #+LaTeX:\pause
   Or is it?
** Example: The class hierarchy
   Let's write a class hierarchy!
   #+LaTeX:\pause
   #+LaTeX:\begin{verbatim}
   Class GameObject (no instances)
    \_ Class Weapon (no instances)
        \_ Class Sword (no instances)
            \_ Class FireSword (maybe an instance?)
                \_ ??? (What now?)
   #+LaTeX:\end{verbatim}
   #+LaTeX:\pause

   Suggestions?
   #+LaTeX:\end{center}
** Example: Working toward a solution
   Some solutions:
*** Class explosion
*** Programmatic class creation
*** Data-driven programming
** Example: Solutions
Class explosion:
#+latex:\pause
*** Still class-oriented.
*** Lots of manual class writing
*** Might make code... difficult
    #+LaTeX:\pause
    Do you really want to write FireIceMagicMissileGoldenGodForeverSwordOfDoom?
** Example: Solutions
Programmatic class creation:
#+latex:\pause
*** May not actually be possible in your language
*** Programmatic classes are sketchy, at best. Using them may be difficult and arcane.
*** Reusability possibly out the window.
** Example: Solutions
Data-driven programming
#+latex:\pause
*** Eject! Eject!
    Class-orientation can't actually do what you want, so you need to use something else
*** Blessing
    You've escaped the hell that is class-based programming
** Example: Screw this.
   #+latex:\begin{block}{From a paper on Self}
   "How hardcore do you want to be?
   How many lifetimes do you want to waste?"
   #+latex:\end{block}
* What is Object-oriented Programming?
** What is Object-Oriented Programming?
   #+latex:\begin{center}
   Object-oriented programming: A different paradigm for putting together your program.
   #+latex:\end{center}
** Overview of objects
#+LaTeX:\pause
*** Objects are like other objects, and share each others' behavior.
#+LaTeX:\pause
*** No separate entity to confuse the process.
#+LaTeX:\pause
*** Delegate behavior *and* data.
** Structuring an application with objects
#+LaTeX:\pause
*** Create an object
#+LaTeX:\pause
*** Copy or delegate to that object
#+LaTeX:\pause
*** New object can act as a prototype for other objects
#+LaTeX:\pause
*** Don't Panic!
    Lots of other "object-oriented" design principles you learned still apply, in a good way.
** Example: Game objects revisited
Back to the game. Now with objects:
#+LaTeX:\pause
   #+LaTeX:\begin{verbatim}
   Object
    \_ Object, add some Weapon-like attributes
        \_ Weapon, add some Sword-like attributes
            \_ Sword, add some Fire-like attributes
                \_ ???, add some ???-like attributes
   #+LaTeX:\end{verbatim}
#+LaTeX:\pause
    #+latex:\begin{center}
    #+LaTeX:\includegraphics[height=2cm]{/home/sykopomp/hackery/lisp/sheeple/presentation/Awesome_Face_bigger.png}

    Awesome!
    #+latex:\end{center}
** Example: That's totally not different at all! D:<
What's the difference?
*** Make objects different by making them different
*** Incremental development on a live system
*** Objects defined by what they do, and what attributes they have, not by an abstract blueprint
** Example (cont'd)
What does this mean?
*** Create a new object that implements the new behavior. Delegate what you want.
#+LaTeX:\pause
*** Programmatic creation of objects is easy and natural (not like there's any other way to do it!)
#+LaTeX:\pause
*** Heck, make programmatic object creation part of the design tool
#+LaTeX:\pause

    #+latex:\end{center}
** Object-orientation in the wild
*** Prototype and Properties "patterns" (for classes)
*** JavaScript
*** MUDs
**** LambdaMOO
**** LPC
**** DGD
* CLOS
** CLOS
*** Common Lisp Object System. Integrates with Common Lisp
*** Multiple inheritance
*** Multiple dispatch
*** Method combination
*** Metaobject Protocol
** More dynamic than other class-based systems
#+LaTeX:\pause
*** Redefinition of classes with instance updates
    (Very complicated, though. See CLHS 4.3.6)
#+LaTeX:\pause
*** Adding/removing generic functions and methods.
**** Does not require redefinition of a class.
**** Generic functions and classes conceptually separate.
**** Very dynamic
#+LaTeX:\pause
*** Instances can change classes
    (Again, pretty tricky. CLHS 7.2)
** WANT
   I want:
#+latex:\pause
*** something with CLOS' nice features, but object-oriented
#+latex:\pause
*** something portable, built on Common Lisp
#+latex:\pause
*** an API similar to CLOS.
#+latex:\pause
*** A pony.

** Influences
*** Written by Josh Marchán and Adlai Chandrasekhar
*** Influenced by:
**** CLOS
**** Slate: http://slatelanguage.org
**** Self: http://research.sun.com/self
**** Io: http://iolanguage.com
**** LambdaMOO and similar MUD systems
** Objects, with delicious CLOS
*** Lisp is dynamic. The object system should dynamic.
   #+LaTeX:\pause
*** CLOS+Object-orientation. What more could you possibly want?
   #+LaTeX:\pause
   #+BEGIN_SRC lisp
   (object :parents *pony*) => Here's your pony.
   #+END_SRC

** Looks suspiciouly like CLOS on the surface
*** Multiple inheritance
*** Multiple dispatch
*** Method combination
*** Lisp integration (autoboxing)
*** Interface looks like a M-% of CLOS' API
** But has all the proto-goodies you might want underneath...
*** Objects define behavior
*** Completely dynamic
*** Dynamic delegation of data (not just behavior)
** ...and it still performs well
   Self showed that prototype languages can be efficient.
*** Self-inspired maps ("hidden classes")
*** Fast property access, reuse of known techniques from Class-land
*** Delegation can lead to smaller memory footprint
    NewtonScript exploited this for an embedded system.
** It's fun.
   Being able to manipulate application on the fly makes programming more fun and productive!

** Object API
   Object creation
   #+LaTeX:\pause
*** Make a new object
    #+LaTeX:\begin{verbatim}
    (object)
    #+LaTeX:\end{verbatim}
    #+LaTeX:\pause
*** Make a new object, that delegates to another object
#+LaTeX:\begin{verbatim}
    (object :parents *foo*)
    #+LaTeX:\end{verbatim}
   #+LaTeX:\pause
*** Copy an existing object, directly inheriting its properties locally
    #+LaTeX:\begin{verbatim}
    (clone *foo*)
    #+LaTeX:\end{verbatim}
** Property API
   Creating and managing properties
   #+LaTeX:\pause
*** Add a property
    #+LaTeX:\begin{verbatim}
    (add-property *foo* 'name "value")
    #+LaTeX:\end{verbatim}
    #+LaTeX:\pause
*** Access a property
    #+LaTeX:\begin{verbatim}
    (property-value *foo* 'name)
    #+LaTeX:\end{verbatim}
    #+LaTeX:\pause
*** Access a delegated property from an object's descendant
    #+LaTeX:\begin{verbatim}
    (property-value (object :parents *foo*) 'name)
    #+LaTeX:\end{verbatim}
    #+LaTeX:\pause
*** Remove the property
    #+LaTeX:\begin{verbatim}
    (remove-property *foo* 'name)
    #+LaTeX:\end{verbatim}
** Message API
   Creating messages, replies, and dispatching them
   #+LaTeX:\pause
*** Create a message (think generic functions)
#+LaTeX:\begin{verbatim}
(defmessage synergize (a b)
  (:documentation "Synergizes A and B")) 
#+LaTeX:\end{verbatim}
#+LaTeX:\pause
*** Create a reply (think methods)
#+LaTeX:\begin{verbatim}
(defreply synergize ((a =string=) (b =string=)) 
  (concatenate 'string a b))
  #+LaTeX:\end{verbatim}
#+LaTeX:\pause
*** Call a message (think uhh... calling a function :D)
#+LaTeX:\begin{verbatim}
(synergize "foo" "bar") => "foobar" 
#+LaTeX:\end{verbatim}

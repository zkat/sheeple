About
=====

Sheeple is a Dynamic, CLOS-like, Delegative Prototype-based Object-Oriented Programming Framework
(or "POOP Framework") that strives to optimize application flexibility, minimize cost while
increasing value, maximize programmer resources, and empower application implementers to better
assist them in leveraging modern paradigms in order to proactively achieve next-generation synergy
in tomorrow's web 3.0 world. It is implemented in (mostly) ANSI Common Lisp. Sheeple is fully
buzzword compliant.

Sheeple was originally written as a persistent library for use with [Sykosomatic][9]. Because of a
desire to use it in other applications, it was rewritten as a regular prototype object system and
provided as a standalone library meant for general-purpose OO hackery.

Persistent Sheeple has not been abandoned, instead, it's been implemented as a [separate library][7]
using Sheeple's reflective features.

Sheeple is inspired by a number of Object-Oriented systems, mainly:

* [CLOS][3], the Common Lisp Object System.
* [MOO][5], implemented and used by [LambdaMOO][8]
* [Slate][6], a Smalltalk-like language with Prototype Multiple Dispatch that Sheeple bases its
  message dispatch system on.
* [Self][10], another Smalltalk-like language with lots of papers written about it, and the concept
  of prototype OO.
* [Io][4], a pure prototype-based language. Sheeple, like Io, implements differential inheritance.

It was written with the purpose of providing a lot of the goodies of CLOS programming in a
completely prototype-based environment. As such, it shares a lot of features and syntax with
CLOS. The most notable features are multiple inheritance and multimethods, called multimessages).

Supported Platforms
-------------------
Confirmed to work (pass all tests):

* SBCL
* Clozure CL
* GNU CLISP
* LispWorks (was tested a while ago -- will probably pass again)

Sheeple doesn't use any OS-specific code (or threads), so it should be fairly stable on all
operating systems. OSX and Linux x86 have both been actually tested on the aforementioned platforms.

Loading Sheeple
---------------
It's fairly effortless to get Sheeple working. To get started, simply

         (asdf:oos 'asdf:load-op 'sheeple)
         (in-package sheeple-user)

And mess around from there. Be aware that if your implementation does not include ASDF, you will
have to acquire it and load it yourself. Clisp, for example, will require this.
For information on how to do this, check out [Cliki][1], or the [ASDF Homepage][2].

Sheeple should work on most Lisp implementations that support weak pointers and hash tables with key
weakness, although it's mainly written and tested in SBCL and Clozure CL on Linux x86.

Sheeple also includes a suite of tests you can run on whatever platform you're trying to get it
to work on. The test suite depends on [Fiveam][11]. To run it:

         (asdf:oos 'asdf:test-op 'sheeple)

And watch the tests scroll by. All tests should pass as long as you're using a tagged release.

Notes
-----
If you want to get Sheeple to run on your favorite platform, feel free to e-mail me: sykopomp, in
the domain of sykosomatic, tld org. I'll help as much as I can (or even do the work for you). Any
and all comments are also greatly appreciated.


Features
--------

* Dynamic object management tools (inspection of objects, addition/removal of properties, all
  without requiring full redefinition/object updating).

* Differential inheritance of property values

* Full integration with built-in Lisp types through autoboxing.

* Multiple inheritance through cloning with dynamic inspection and management (adding/removing) of
  parents.

* Multiple dispatch on messages (methods) -- messages specialize on specific instances, and follow
  inheritance hierarchy. Multimessage definition is almost identical to the core of CLOS methods,
  and shares similar semantics.

* :before, :after, and :around messages

* (call-next-message) and (next-message-p)

* A metaobject protocol for inspecting sheeple and altering their behavior through metaclasses.


Using Sheeple
=============

Please refer to #P"doc;user-guide.org" for a quick-and-dirty intro to Sheeple and how to use it.

You can also take a peek at the demo/ directory for examples.

As usual, you can always contact me directly with questions. I also regularly lurk in #lisp@freenode
(as sykopomp).
